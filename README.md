# ONLINE CRYPTOGRAPHY COURSE ANALYSIS
## Business Understanding
 Cryptography course was created by a Kenyan entrepreneur and would want to advertise it on her blog. She currently targets audiences originating from various countries. In the past, she ran ads to advertise a related course on the same blog and collected dat on the process. Using R programming language we would help her identify which individuals are most likely to click on her ads.


## Defining the Metric for Success
1) We identify the most important features for identifying which individuals are most likely to click on the ads.

* Performing univariate and Bivariate analysis


## Data Relevance
* How accurate is the data at identifying which individuals are most likely to click on her ads?
* Was the dataset sufficient?
* Was the data biased?
* Is the data source a reliable source?
